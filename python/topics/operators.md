# Operators in Python

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

```python
# Arithmetic Operators
x = 5
y = 2
print(x + y)  # Addition
print(x - y)  # Subtraction
print(x * y)  # Multiplication
print(x / y)  # Division
print(x % y)  # Modulus
print(x ** y) # Exponentiation
```

**Key Points:**
- Python supports arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise, membership, and identity operators.
- Use parentheses to control order of operations.

## Real-time Project Example
In a billing system, you can use operators to calculate total price:

```python
unit_price = 20
quantity = 3
total = unit_price * quantity
print(f"Total: {total}")
```

## Interview Questions & Answers
**Q1: What is the difference between '==' and 'is' in Python?**
A: '==' checks for value equality, while 'is' checks for object identity (whether two variables point to the same object in memory).

**Q2: How do logical operators work in Python?**
A: Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) are used to combine conditional statements.

**Q3: What does the '//' operator do?**
A: '//' is the floor division operator, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
