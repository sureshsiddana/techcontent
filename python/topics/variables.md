# Variables and Data Types in Python

Variables are used to store data in Python. Python is dynamically typed, so you do not need to declare the type of variable.

```python
# Assigning values to variables
x = 10           # integer
name = "Alice"   # string
pi = 3.14        # float
is_valid = True  # boolean
```

**Key Points:**
- No need to declare variable types.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Use snake_case for variable names by convention.

## Real-time Project Example
Suppose you are building a student management system. You can use variables to store student details:

```python
student_id = 101
student_name = "John Doe"
student_score = 88.5
```

## Interview Questions & Answers
**Q1: What is the difference between a variable and a constant?**
A: A variable can change its value during program execution, while a constant remains the same. Python does not have built-in constant types, but by convention, uppercase names are used for constants.

**Q2: How does Python handle variable types?**
A: Python uses dynamic typing, so the type is determined at runtime and can change as the variable is reassigned.

**Q3: What are mutable and immutable data types?**
A: Mutable types (like lists, dicts) can be changed after creation. Immutable types (like int, str, tuple) cannot be changed after creation.
