# AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

## Key Concepts
- EC2 provides scalable virtual servers (instances) in the cloud.
- Supports multiple instance types, AMIs, and pricing models (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot).
- Enables auto scaling, load balancing, and secure networking.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Web Server Hosting

### Example 2: Batch Processing
- Use Spot Instances for cost-effective data processing jobs.

### Example 3: Auto Scaling
- Automatically add/remove instances based on demand.
