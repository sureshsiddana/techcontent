# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

## Key Concepts
- **Object Storage:** S3 stores data as objects within buckets.
- **Buckets:** Containers for storing objects (files, metadata).
- **Scalability:** Virtually unlimited storage, automatic scaling.
- **Durability & Availability:** 99.999999999% durability, multiple storage classes.
- **Access Control:** IAM policies, bucket policies, ACLs, and S3 Block Public Access.
- **Versioning:** Keep multiple variants of an object.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Automate transition and expiration of objects.
- **Event Notifications:** Trigger workflows (e.g., Lambda) on object events.

## Real-World Example
- **Static Website Hosting:** Host static websites directly from S3 buckets.
- **Backup & Restore:** Use S3 for backup storage and disaster recovery.
- **Data Lake:** Store big data for analytics (integrates with AWS analytics services).
