# History of AI

## Key Concepts
- AI research began in the 1950s with pioneers like Alan Turing and John McCarthy.
- Major milestones: Turing Test, ELIZA chatbot, Deep Blue chess, AlphaGo, GPT models.
- AI has experienced cycles of optimism, funding, and "AI winters."

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Turing Test
- Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 to test a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.

### Example 2: Deep Blue vs. Kasparov
- IBM's Deep Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

### Example 3: AlphaGo
- DeepMind's AlphaGo defeated Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016, showcasing deep learning's power.
