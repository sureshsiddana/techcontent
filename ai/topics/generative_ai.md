# Generative AI Overview

## Key Concepts
- Generative AI (GenAI) creates new content (text, images, audio, code) using machine learning models.
- Key models: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Transformers (GPT, DALL-E).
- Used for content creation, data augmentation, and creative applications.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Text Generation
- GPT models generate human-like text for chatbots, writing assistants, and more.

### Example 2: Image Generation
- DALL-E and Stable Diffusion create realistic images from text prompts.

### Example 3: Music and Audio Generation
- AI models compose music and generate speech.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What is generative AI?**
A: GenAI refers to AI systems that can generate new data similar to their training data.

**Q2: Real-time: How is GenAI used in business?**
A: For content creation, marketing, product design, and rapid prototyping.

**Q3: What are GANs and how do they work?**
A: GANs consist of a generator and discriminator network competing to create realistic data.
