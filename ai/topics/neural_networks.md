# Neural Networks

## Key Concepts
- Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain.
- Consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
- Types: feedforward, convolutional, recurrent, and more.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Handwritten Digit Recognition
- MNIST dataset classification using neural networks.

### Example 2: Sentiment Analysis
- Neural networks analyze text to determine sentiment (positive/negative).

### Example 3: Stock Price Prediction
- RNNs and LSTMs are used for time series forecasting.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What is a neural network?**
A: A neural network is a set of algorithms modeled after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns.

**Q2: Real-time: How do you choose the number of layers in a neural network?**
A: It depends on the complexity of the problem and data; deeper networks can model more complex patterns but risk overfitting.

**Q3: What is backpropagation?
A: Backpropagation is the algorithm for training neural networks by adjusting weights based on error gradients.
