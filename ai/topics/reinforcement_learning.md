# Reinforcement Learning

## Key Concepts
- Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where agents learn by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
- Key elements: agent, environment, state, action, reward, policy, value function.
- RL is used for sequential decision-making problems.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Game Playing
- AlphaGo and OpenAI Five use RL to master complex games.

### Example 2: Robotics
- RL enables robots to learn tasks like walking, grasping, or navigation.

### Example 3: Recommendation Systems
- RL optimizes recommendations by learning user preferences over time.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What is reinforcement learning?**
A: RL is a machine learning paradigm where agents learn optimal actions through trial and error, guided by rewards.

**Q2: Real-time: How is RL used in self-driving cars?**
A: RL helps vehicles learn to make driving decisions by maximizing safety and efficiency rewards.

**Q3: What is the difference between policy and value function?**
A: Policy defines the agent's behavior; value function estimates expected rewards for states or actions.
