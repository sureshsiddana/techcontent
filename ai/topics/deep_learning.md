# Deep Learning Overview

## Key Concepts
- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning using neural networks with many layers.
- Excels at learning from large, complex datasets (images, audio, text).
- Key architectures: feedforward, convolutional (CNN), recurrent (RNN), transformers.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Image Classification
- CNNs classify images in applications like medical imaging and self-driving cars.

### Example 2: Speech Recognition
- Deep learning powers voice assistants and transcription services.

### Example 3: Language Translation
- Neural machine translation (NMT) models like Google Translate use deep learning.
