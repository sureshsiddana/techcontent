# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Key Concepts
- NLP is a field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- Tasks: text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, question answering, summarization.
- Key models: RNNs, LSTMs, transformers (BERT, GPT).

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Sentiment Analysis
- Analyzing customer reviews to determine positive or negative sentiment.

### Example 2: Chatbots
- Virtual assistants and customer support bots use NLP for conversation.

### Example 3: Machine Translation
- Google Translate and DeepL use NLP for translating text between languages.
