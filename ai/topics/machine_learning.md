# Machine Learning Overview

## Key Concepts
- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data.
- Types: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement learning.
- Key steps: data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Email Spam Detection
- ML models classify emails as spam or not spam based on features.

### Example 2: Image Recognition
- ML is used to identify objects in photos (e.g., Google Photos).

### Example 3: Predictive Analytics
- ML predicts customer churn, stock prices, or equipment failure.
