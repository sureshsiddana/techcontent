# Types of AI (Narrow, General, Super)

## Key Concepts
- Narrow AI (Weak AI): Specialized for specific tasks (e.g., voice assistants, spam filters).
- General AI (Strong AI): Hypothetical, can perform any intellectual task a human can.
- Super AI: Surpasses human intelligence in all aspects; theoretical.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Narrow AI
- Google Translate, facial recognition, and chatbots are all narrow AI.

### Example 2: General AI
- No true general AI exists yet; current research aims to achieve it.

### Example 3: Super AI
- Super AI is a concept in science fiction and future studies.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What is the difference between narrow and general AI?**
A: Narrow AI is task-specific; general AI would have broad, human-like intelligence.

**Q2: Real-time: Give an example of narrow AI in healthcare.**
A: AI systems that analyze X-rays or predict patient risk are narrow AI.

**Q3: What are the risks of superintelligent AI?**
A: Potential loss of human control, ethical concerns, and existential risks.
