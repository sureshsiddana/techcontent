# Cyber Security: Security Operations Center (SOC) & SOAR (Advanced)

## Key Concepts
- **SOC (Security Operations Center):** Centralized team for monitoring, detecting, and responding to threats.
- **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):** Automates incident response workflows.
- **Threat Intelligence:** Integrating feeds for proactive defense.
- **Playbooks:** Automated response procedures for common incidents.
- **Metrics:** Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).

## Advanced Example
- Using SOAR to automatically isolate compromised endpoints and notify stakeholders during a phishing attack.

## Best Practices
- Regularly update playbooks and integrate with threat intelligence.
- Measure and improve response times.
- Foster collaboration between SOC analysts and IT teams.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: What is the role of SOAR in a modern SOC?**
A: It automates repetitive tasks, accelerates response, and reduces analyst fatigue.

**Q: How do you measure SOC effectiveness?**
A: Track metrics like MTTD, MTTR, and incident closure rates.
