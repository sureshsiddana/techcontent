# Cyber Security: Threat Intelligence & Hunting (Advanced)

## Key Concepts
- **Threat Intelligence:** Collecting and analyzing data on current and emerging threats.
- **Threat Hunting:** Proactively searching for threats in the environment.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Hashes, IPs, domains, and patterns.
- **TTPs:** Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures used by attackers.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework:** Standardized knowledge base for threat behaviors.

## Advanced Example
- Using MITRE ATT&CK to map adversary behavior and hunt for lateral movement in logs.

## Best Practices
- Integrate threat intelligence feeds into SIEM/SOAR.
- Regularly update detection rules and playbooks.
- Collaborate with industry peers for shared intelligence.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: What is the difference between threat intelligence and threat hunting?**
A: Intelligence is about gathering data; hunting is about actively searching for threats.

**Q: How do you use MITRE ATT&CK in security operations?**
