# Cyber Security Case Study: Ransomware Response in Healthcare

## Scenario
A large hospital network is hit by a ransomware attack that encrypts patient records and demands payment. The IT and security teams must respond quickly to restore operations and protect sensitive data.

## Steps Taken
1. **Detection:** Security monitoring tools alert the SOC to unusual file encryption activity.
2. **Containment:** Infected systems are isolated from the network to prevent spread.
3. **Eradication:** Malware is removed using endpoint protection and forensic analysis.
4. **Recovery:** Patient records are restored from secure, offline backups.
5. **Communication:** Incident is reported to authorities and patients are notified.
6. **Post-Incident Review:** Security policies and backup procedures are updated.

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of regular, offline backups.
- Need for rapid detection and response.
- Value of user training to recognize phishing emails.
