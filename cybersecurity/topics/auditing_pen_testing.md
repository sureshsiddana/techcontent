# Security Auditing & Penetration Testing

## Key Concepts
- **Security Auditing:** Systematic evaluation of security policies, controls, and procedures.
- **Penetration Testing (Pentesting):** Simulated cyberattack to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Types of Pentests:** Black-box, white-box, gray-box.
- **Tools:** Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nessus, OWASP ZAP.
- **Reporting:** Documenting findings, risk levels, and remediation steps.

## Advanced Example
- Conducting a web application pentest using Burp Suite to find and exploit XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices
- Always get written authorization before testing.
- Follow a structured methodology (e.g., OWASP Testing Guide).
- Prioritize remediation based on risk.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: What is the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?**
A: Scanning identifies potential issues; pentesting actively exploits them to assess impact.

**Q: What is a black-box test?**
A: Testing with no prior knowledge of the system.
