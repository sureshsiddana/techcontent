# Zero Trust Security

## Key Concepts
- **Zero Trust Model:** Never trust, always verify. Every access request is authenticated, authorized, and encrypted.
- **Microsegmentation:** Dividing networks into granular zones for better control.
- **Least Privilege:** Users and systems get only the access they need.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time analysis of user and device behavior.
- **Identity-Centric Security:** Strong authentication and adaptive access controls.

## Advanced Example
- Implementing Zero Trust in a hybrid cloud using identity providers, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring tools.

## Best Practices
- Assume breach and design controls accordingly.
- Use MFA, device posture checks, and encrypted communications.
- Regularly review and update access policies.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: How does Zero Trust differ from traditional perimeter security?**
A: Zero Trust assumes no implicit trust, even inside the network, and requires verification for every access.

**Q: What is microsegmentation?**
A: Breaking the network into smaller segments to limit lateral movement by attackers.
