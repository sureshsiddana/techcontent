# Cyber Security: API & Microservices Security (Advanced)

## Key Concepts
- **API Authentication:** OAuth 2.0, JWT, API keys.
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
- **Input Validation & Output Encoding:** Prevent injection and XSS.
- **Service Mesh Security:** mTLS, policy enforcement, and observability.
- **API Gateway:** Centralized control for authentication, authorization, and monitoring.

## Advanced Example
- Securing a REST API with OAuth 2.0 and validating JWT tokens in a microservices architecture.

## Best Practices
- Use HTTPS for all API traffic.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization.
- Monitor and log all API activity.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: How do you secure microservices communication?**
A: Use mTLS, API gateways, and strong authentication.

**Q: What is the role of an API gateway?**
A: It provides centralized security, traffic management, and monitoring for APIs.
