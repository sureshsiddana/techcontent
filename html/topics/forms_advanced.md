# HTML Forms: Security, Accessibility, and UX (Advanced)

## Key Concepts
- **Form Validation:** Client-side (HTML5, JavaScript) and server-side validation for security.
- **Accessibility:** Use `<label>`, ARIA attributes, and error messages for screen readers.
- **Security:** Prevent XSS, CSRF, and injection attacks. Use HTTPS for form submissions.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Ensure forms work without JavaScript.
- **UX:** Inline validation, clear error messages, and logical tab order.

## Advanced Example
```html
<form action="/submit" method="POST" autocomplete="on">
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required aria-describedby="emailHelp">
  <span id="emailHelp">We'll never share your email.</span>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Best Practices
- Always validate input on the server.
- Use HTTPS and set secure cookies.
- Provide accessible error feedback.
