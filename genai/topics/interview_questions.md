# GenAI Interview Questions (50+ Real-Time Scenarios)

## Key Concepts
- GenAI interviews test knowledge of generative models, prompt engineering, ethics, and real-world applications.
- Real-world scenarios focus on debugging, evaluation, deployment, and risk mitigation.

### 1. What is Generative AI?
**A:** GenAI is a field of AI focused on creating new data or content using machine learning models.

### 2. What are the main types of generative models?
**A:** GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and transformers.

### 3. Real-time: How would you evaluate the quality of generated images?
**A:** Use FID, IS, human evaluation, and diversity metrics.

### 4. What is prompt engineering?
**A:** Crafting input prompts to guide GenAI models for desired outputs.

### 5. Real-time: How do you mitigate bias in GenAI outputs?
**A:** Use diverse training data, audit outputs, and apply fairness constraints.

### 6. What is a GAN and how does it work?
**A:** GANs use a generator and discriminator in adversarial training to create realistic data.

### 7. Real-time: How do you deploy a GenAI model for production use?
**A:** Use APIs, containerization, and cloud services for scalable, secure deployment.

### 8. What are diffusion models?
**A:** Models that generate data by iteratively denoising random noise.

### 9. Real-time: How do you ensure copyright compliance with GenAI?
**A:** Track data sources, use watermarking, and review outputs for originality.

### 10. What is the role of transformers in GenAI?
**A:** Transformers enable large-scale, high-quality text, image, and audio generation.
