# Code Generation

## Key Concepts
- Code generation uses AI models to write, complete, or refactor code from prompts or context.
- Key models: Codex (OpenAI), Copilot, CodeGen, StarCoder.
- Applications: code completion, bug fixing, documentation, test generation.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: GitHub Copilot
- Suggests code completions and snippets in real time.

### Example 2: OpenAI Codex
- Generates code from natural language instructions.

### Example 3: Test Generation
- AI tools create unit tests from code or requirements.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: How do code generation models work?**
A: They use large language models trained on code to predict and generate code from context or prompts.

**Q2: Real-time: How do you ensure generated code is secure and correct?**
A: Use static analysis, code review, and test generation; combine AI with human oversight.

**Q3: What are the limitations of code generation models?**
A: May generate insecure, inefficient, or non-idiomatic code; require validation.
