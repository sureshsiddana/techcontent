# GenAI Ethics & Risks

## Key Concepts
- GenAI raises ethical concerns: bias, misinformation, copyright, privacy, and misuse.
- Responsible AI development requires transparency, fairness, and accountability.
- Mitigation: dataset curation, model auditing, watermarking, and human oversight.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Deepfakes
- GANs create realistic fake videos, raising concerns about misinformation and consent.

### Example 2: Copyright Issues
- AI-generated art and music may infringe on original creators' rights.

### Example 3: Bias in Generated Content
- Models may perpetuate stereotypes or unfair representations.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What are the main ethical risks of GenAI?**
A: Misinformation, bias, copyright infringement, privacy violations, and malicious use.

**Q2: Real-time: How can organizations mitigate GenAI risks?**
A: Use diverse datasets, audit outputs, watermark content, and involve human review.

**Q3: What is model watermarking?**
A: Embedding signals in generated content to identify AI origin and prevent misuse.
