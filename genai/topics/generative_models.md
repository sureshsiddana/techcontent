# Generative Models Overview

## Key Concepts
- Generative models learn to create new data similar to their training data.
- Main types: GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and transformers.
- Used for text, image, audio, and code generation.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: GANs for Image Synthesis
- StyleGAN generates realistic human faces.

### Example 2: VAEs for Data Compression
- VAEs generate new samples and compress data in unsupervised learning.

### Example 3: Transformers for Text Generation
- GPT-4 generates human-like text for chatbots and content creation.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What is a generative model?**
A: A model that learns the underlying distribution of data to generate new, similar samples.

**Q2: Real-time: How do GANs differ from VAEs?**
A: GANs use adversarial training for sharp outputs; VAEs use probabilistic encoding for smooth latent spaces.

**Q3: What are diffusion models used for?**
A: High-quality image and audio generation by iteratively refining noise into data.
