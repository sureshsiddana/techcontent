# Audio & Music Generation

## Key Concepts
- Audio generation uses AI to synthesize speech, music, and sound effects.
- Key models: WaveNet, Jukebox, diffusion models, transformers.
- Applications: music composition, voice assistants, dubbing, sound design.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Jukebox (OpenAI)
- Generates original music in various genres and styles.

### Example 2: WaveNet (DeepMind)
- Produces realistic human speech for voice assistants.

### Example 3: Audio Diffusion Models
- Create high-fidelity soundscapes and effects from noise.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: How do AI models generate music?**
A: By learning patterns in musical data and generating new sequences using neural networks.

**Q2: Real-time: How do you control the style or genre of generated audio?**
A: Use conditioning (genre, artist, mood) or prompt engineering.

**Q3: What are challenges in audio generation?**
A: Coherence, quality, copyright, and real-time synthesis.
