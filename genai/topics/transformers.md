# Transformers (GPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)

## Key Concepts
- Transformers are deep learning models using self-attention for sequence modeling.
- Foundation for state-of-the-art text, image, and multimodal generation.
- Examples: GPT (text), DALL-E (text-to-image), Stable Diffusion (image synthesis).

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: GPT-4 for Text Generation
- Generates human-like text for chatbots, writing assistants, and more.

### Example 2: DALL-E for Image Generation
- Creates original images from natural language prompts.

### Example 3: Stable Diffusion for Art
- Produces high-quality, customizable images from text.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What is a transformer model?**
A: A neural network architecture using self-attention, excelling at sequence-to-sequence tasks in NLP and vision.

**Q2: Real-time: How do transformers enable multimodal AI?**
A: By processing and aligning text, image, and audio data in a unified architecture.

**Q3: What are the main advantages of transformers over RNNs?**
A: Parallelization, long-range dependency modeling, and scalability.
