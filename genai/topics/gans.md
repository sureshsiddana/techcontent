# GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

## Key Concepts
- GANs consist of a generator and discriminator in a game-theoretic setup.
- Generator creates fake data; discriminator distinguishes real from fake.
- Used for image synthesis, data augmentation, and creative applications.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: DeepFake Generation
- GANs create realistic face swaps in videos.

### Example 2: Art Generation
- GANs generate new artworks and styles (e.g., DeepArt, Artbreeder).

### Example 3: Data Augmentation
- GANs synthesize new training data for ML models.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What is a GAN?**
A: A generative model with two networks (generator and discriminator) trained adversarially.

**Q2: Real-time: How do you train a GAN?**
A: Alternate training between generator and discriminator, optimizing their respective losses.

**Q3: What are common challenges in GAN training?**
A: Mode collapse, non-convergence, and vanishing gradients.
