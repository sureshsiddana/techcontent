# Diffusion Models

## Key Concepts
- Diffusion models generate data by iteratively refining random noise into structured outputs.
- Used for high-quality image, audio, and video generation.
- Examples: Stable Diffusion, Imagen, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Stable Diffusion
- Generates photorealistic images from text prompts.

### Example 2: Audio Generation
- Diffusion models synthesize realistic speech and music.

### Example 3: Video Generation
- Research models generate short video clips from noise or text.

## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What is a diffusion model?**
A: A generative model that creates data by gradually denoising random noise through learned steps.

**Q2: Real-time: How do diffusion models differ from GANs?**
A: Diffusion models use iterative denoising, often producing higher quality and more stable results than GANs.

**Q3: What are the main applications of diffusion models?**
A: Text-to-image, audio, and video generation.
